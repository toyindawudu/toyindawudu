### My name is Toyin ðŸ˜Š, and I am a self-taught developer based in Coventry, Warwickshire in the Midlands, United Kingdom

I am currently working on building and adding more interesting projects to my portfolio and writing more SCSS & JavaScript in my projects. With SCSS I am paying attention to using mixins and functions, while with JavaScript I am writing more ES6 and working with interpreting and manipulating data from APIs where possible. 

In 2021, I'm intentionally studying React, Node and GraphQL and preferably MongoDB as my database. These technologies excite me and I cannot wait to be proficient with them. I am open to collaborations and looking to help beginners who might need help understanding JavaScript.
