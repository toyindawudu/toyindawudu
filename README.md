### My name is Toyin ðŸ˜Š, and I am a self-taught developer based in Coventry, Warwickshire in the Midlands, United Kingdom

I am currently working on building and adding more interesting projects to my portfolio and writing more SCSS & JavaScript in my projects. With SCSS I am paying attention to using mixins and functions, while with JavaScript I am writing more ES6 and working with interpreting and manipulating data from APIs where possible.
